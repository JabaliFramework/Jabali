 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/banda/loop/no-products-found.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion Banda will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
