PHP Session Based Cart System is pretty simple and fast way for listing small amount of products.

This script doesn't include any payment method or payment page. This script lists manually added products, you can add that products to your shopping cart, remove them, change quantity via sessions.

Also this script is a good exercise to understand PHP session arrays.

You can easily add - remove items from shopping cart, all data stored in sessions and system not uses a database.

In source code, you can add - remove products manually, if you want you can add product id to code yourself. You have to know basic HTML for this. If you wish, you can code for database integration.

If you want to add same product to shopping cart more then once, system automatically update quantity of existing one.

When you submit "**Give Order**" button, form elements and order detail passed via form. You can code payment options here or you can change the forms action to another script page. If you wish, you can send form elements and order detail via email, or you can took them into a database table (do not forget to clean the variables, for example you can use mysql_real_escape_string).

For currency change, open root/index.php with text/HTML editor. You can change **$currency symbol**.
